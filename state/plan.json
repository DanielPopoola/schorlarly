      "summary": "The pervasive infiltration of microplastics fundamentally alters the physical and biological integrity of marine environments, acting as a multifaceted stressor that degrades coastal habitats and undermines marine food webs. The paper highlights that the relationship between biodiversity loss and ecosystem functioning is complex, requiring rigorous multifactorial approaches to disentangle the specific impacts of microplastics from other ecological interactions.",

      "summary": "The paper recommends a policy framework that prioritizes preventing plastic waste at the source rather than remediation, specifically targeting industries like textiles and cosmetics. It argues that interventions must be guided by ecological models that protect specific functional groups rather than relying on general biodiversity metrics. Finally, it stresses the urgent need for regulation to address the biological risks posed by nanoplastics.",
